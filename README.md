This repo contains the code snippets used throughout the Sensing canine behavior from an edge ML-driven haptic interface research project (https://experiment.com/projects/a-framework-and-case-study-of-ai-avatars-for-non-human-entities)

The main dataset used is "Movement Sensor Dataset for Dog Behavior Classification" (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/vxhx934tbn/3)

"data-manipulation.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook with the procedures used to process the main dataset to conform with the research specifications, especially size.

"ManipulatedDogMoveData.csv" is the result of the data-manipulation pipeline, which is used for the ML inferences in the project.
